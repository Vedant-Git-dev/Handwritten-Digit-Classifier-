# 🧠 MNIST Handwritten Digit Classifier using CNN

This project is a deep learning model built with TensorFlow and Keras to classify handwritten digits from the famous MNIST dataset. It achieved **99.08% test accuracy** using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), tuned for performance and trained from scratch.

## 📊 Final Accuracy

✅ **99.08% Accuracy on Test Set**

## 📁 Dataset

The [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) consists of:
- 60,000 training images
- 10,000 test images  
Each image is **28x28 grayscale** representing digits from 0 to 9.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- Built a CNN model using `Conv2D`, `MaxPooling2D`, `Flatten`, and `Dense` layers
- Used `ReLU` activation and `Softmax` for output classification
- Normalized image pixel values to improve training efficiency
- Tuned hyperparameters using **Keras Tuner**
- Evaluated model performance using training/validation/test sets
- Saved the best model using the `.keras` format

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Understood how Convolution, Pooling, Flattening, and Dense layers work together
- Learned about backpropagation, gradients, and loss optimization
- Gained insights into hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation
- Discovered the importance of preprocessing and data normalization

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Keras Tuner (for hyperparameter tuning)

## ✅ Conclusion

This project served as a powerful introduction to the world of Computer Vision and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Through building and fine-tuning a handwritten digit classifier, I not only achieved **99.08% accuracy** on the MNIST test set but also gained a strong understanding of the theory and intuition behind each component of a deep learning model.

This hands-on experience helped me bridge the gap between using models and **understanding what makes them work** — from convolution and pooling layers to hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation.

I'm excited to apply this knowledge to more advanced datasets and challenges in the future!
